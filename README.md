I'm experimenting with conversational AI in python.  
So far it is just a small demo using pre-trained models.

### Components:
* ASR using vosk
* Conversation using DialoGPT-small (without history)
* TTS using gTTS

###  Roadmap:
* [x] Simple conversation loop
* [ ] Use offline TTS
* [ ] Preprocess user input (punctuation)
* [ ] Detect user mood/attitude
* [ ] Custom speaker
* [ ] Mood of speaker
* [ ] Guided conversation (state, intentions, termination)
* [ ] Package for integration in other projects
